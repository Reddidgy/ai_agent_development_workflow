# ___NAME___ Development AI Prompt

This directory contains the primary system prompt template used to initialize AI development agents for software engineering tasks.

## What is it?

EXAMPLE:
The `___FILENAME___.md` is a foundational persona and rule-set designed for AI agents. It establishes:
- **Role**: ___ROLE___
- **Mission**: Example :Architecting and building clean, scalable, and maintainable software.
- **Strict Guidelines**: Example: Mandatory confirmation sentences, OS-specific command awareness, and non-negotiable quality priorities.
- **Standardized Output**: Example: A structured response format to ensure consistency across all agent interactions.

## How to use it?

EXAMPLE:
1. **Copy the Template**: Copy the entire content of `___FILENAME___.md`.
2. **Replace Placeholders**: Fill in the following placeholders:
    - `___OS_TYPE___`: The operating system you are working on (e.g., MacOs, Linux, Windows).
    - `___APPLICATION_NAME___`: The name of the application being developed.
    - `___YOUR_FIRST_TASK_TO_AI_AGENT___`: The initial objective for the AI agent.
3. **Initialize the Agent**: Provide the updated content as the initial prompt (System Message) to your AI agent.
4. **Iterative Development**: As the project evolves, update the "Application Specification" and "Implemented Features" sections within the prompt to maintain a "source of truth" for the agent.

## Placeholders

EXAMPLE:
- `___OS_TYPE___`: Operating system context for command execution.
- `___APPLICATION_NAME___`: Subject of the development work.
- `___YOUR_FIRST_TASK_TO_AI_AGENT___`: The first goal to be achieved.
